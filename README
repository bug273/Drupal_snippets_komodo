All those plugins are to be used in Komodo IDE for edit, create or modified Drupal modules or tpl files. 
They can be configured with a shortcut for be quick accessed.
To install the snippets you must clone the repos and import them with the komodo's tool interface.
All the snippets were based on the snipMate compilation, so, 
I think they are free to be shared.
